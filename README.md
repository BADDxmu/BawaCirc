The main sources of [BawaCirc](http://www.bio-add.org/BawaCirc) data come from three steps:
----
* ‚≠ê Step 1: Search for circRNA and its corresponding ORFs.
* ‚≠ê Step 2: Look for translation evidence of backward translation proteins in mass spectrometry data.
* ‚≠ê Step 3: Searching for evidence of backward translation proteins being translated in Ribo-seq data.
