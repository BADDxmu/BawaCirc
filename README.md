The [BawaCirc](http://www.bio-add.org/BawaCirc) consists of three steps:
----
* Step1: Search for circRNA and its corresponding ORFs.
* Step2: Look for translation evidence of backward translation proteins in mass spectrometry data.
* Step3: Searching for evidence of backward translation proteins being translated in Ribo-seq data.
