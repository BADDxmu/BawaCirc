The reference sequences of the six species utilized in Step 3 for Ribo-seq data processing.
  Backward_BSJ.fa: the 25nt sequences flanking the BSJ of circRNA corresponding to the backward ORFs spanning the BSJ (A total of 50nt).
  remove.fa: rRNAs and other unwanted contaminants (mRNAs, ncRNAs and circRNA forward ORFs). Then, place the sequences into the “remove.fa” file.
